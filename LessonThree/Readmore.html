                1.Start with simple activities: 
                    Begin by practicing mindfulness during routine tasks like brushing your teeth, washing dishes, or taking a shower. Pay attention to the present moment and engage your senses fully.
                2. Practice mindful breathing: 
                    Take a few minutes each day to focus on your breath. Observe the sensation of each inhale and exhale, allowing yourself to become fully present in the process.
                3. Take mindful pauses:
                    Throughout the day, pause for a moment and bring your attention to your surroundings. Notice the sights, sounds, and sensations around you without judgment.
                4. Engage in mindful eating: 
                    Slow down and savor each bite during meals. Pay attention to the taste, texture, and aroma of the food, fully immersing yourself in the experience.
                5.Cultivate gratitude: 
                    Take time to appreciate the simple joys in your life. Keep a gratitude journal and regularly write down things you are grateful for.
                6.Practice mindful walking: 
                    During a walk, focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the movement of your body, and the environment around you.
                7. Mindful communication: 
                    Listen attentively and be fully present when engaging in conversations. Avoid distractions and give your undivided attention to the person speaking.
                8. Embrace guided meditations: 
                    Use mindfulness apps or guided meditation recordings to assist you in your practice, especially when starting out.
                9. Be patient with yourself: 
                    Mindfulness is a skill that develops over time. Approach it with patience, compassion, and a non-judgmental attitude towards your thoughts and experiences.
